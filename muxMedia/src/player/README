Debugging:
		Mutex adding event into FSM of PLAY_T:
			1. Event callback of HI_PLAYER
			2. SetMedia() thread or timer emits events except;
			
			Event function is re-entery.


File Lists:
		Name rules:
				PLAYER: this program;
				PLAY: one player for one window in this program;
				
		'Player' directory:
				muxPlayerXXX.c : Functions for PLAYER program;
				
		'Player/libRx' directory: RX board for PLAYER program;
				muxRxXXX.c : Functions dependent on RX board;
				muxRxInitXXX.c: Initialization functions for RX board;
				muxRxCBXXX.c: CallBack functions of HiPlayer for one PLAY in RX board;
				muxRxCmdXXX.c: Command handlers for RX board;
				mxuRxPlayXXX.c: functions for one PLAY;
				


About build of link options for Hisilicon:
		1. '--start-group' and '--end-group' must be used in build:
		No these options, it also build OK, but the size of result is different (1700K-2240K), and some binary can not be found when runs;
		
		2. If linking to shared libraries from Hisilicon, 
		failed to create the font: '/etc/sys/fonts/DroidSansFallbackLegacy.ttf'
		The function of 'HI_GO_CreateTextEx' failed: because some functions called by this function are not built into the binary.
		

Build Requirements:
		1. Dynamic link for lixRxMux and Hisilicon
		2. PLAYER: only dependent on libRxMux, never link to libraries from HiSilicon directly;
		3. Only HiDrm is build-it, the symbol of 'HI_DRM_METADATA_Get' can't be found. Why?
